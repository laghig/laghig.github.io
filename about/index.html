	<h1>About me</h1>
	<p>I'm a recent <em>ETH</em> graduate in Management, Technology, & Economics with a background in Environmental Engineering. <br>
	Previously, I worked at the Swiss stock exchange in the Index team. <br>
	I am particularly interested in projects at the intersection of sustainability and data analysis. During my university years I worked on a model that used natural language processing and machine learning to predict the environmental footprint of food products. Moreover,  I estimated permafrost degradation in the Canadian High Arctic by comparing digital elevation models acquired through remote sensing observations over time.</p>
